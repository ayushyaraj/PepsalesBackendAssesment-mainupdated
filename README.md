Notification Service

Overview

This project implements a Notification Service that allows sending and retrieving notifications for users via multiple channels (Email, SMS, and In-App). The service is integrated with an authentication system supporting OTP-based signup and login, enabling secure user management and notification delivery. Notifications are processed synchronously with a retry mechanism for failed attempts.

Authentication:





OTP-based signup and login for secure user access.



Email notifications for OTP delivery during authentication.



Bonus Features:





Retry mechanism for failed notification attempts (up to 3 retries with exponential backoff).



Tech Stack:





Backend: Node.js with Express.js



Database: MongoDB (for storing users and notifications)



Authentication: JWT for session management, Nodemailer for OTP emails



Testing: Jest for unit tests



API Documentation: Postman collection (available in the repository)

Prerequisites





Node.js (v16 or higher)



MongoDB (local or cloud instance, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)



Git



Postman (optional, for testing APIs)



Gmail SMTP or alternative email service (for OTP and email notifications)

Assumptions





Each user is identified by a unique userId (string) generated during signup.



Notification types (email, sms, in-app) are validated before processing.



The recipient field in the notification payload is used for email addresses or phone numbers, depending on the notification type.



Notifications are stored in MongoDB for retrieval and auditing purposes.



Notifications are processed synchronously, with immediate retries for failed attempts.



Failed notifications are retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s).



External services (e.g., email or SMS providers) are mocked for SMS and In-App notifications, while email notifications use Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP for OTP and general notifications.



JWT authentication is required for notification-related endpoints to ensure only authorized users can send or retrieve notifications.

Retry Mechanism: Failed notifications are retried synchronously up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s). The retry count is tracked in the notification metadata.



Authentication: OTP-based signup and login ensure secure user access, with email notifications for OTP delivery.

Deployment (Optional)

The application can be deployed to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS. For this assignment, a deployed instance is not provided, but the code is containerized (Dockerfile included) for easy deployment. To deploy:






Future Improvements





Add a queue-based system (e.g., RabbitMQ) for asynchronous notification processing.



Integrate real SMS providers (e.g., Twilio) for SMS notifications.



Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.



Add support for customizable notification templates.



Enhance OTP security with expiration and rate limits.
